# Temporal AWS SDK

| :warning: **This code is an experiment**: Absolutely no guarantee of backwards compatibility |
| --- |

This repository is a prototype of generated Temporal activities and workflow stubs for all AWS APIs
exposed by AWS Go SDK.

Generated activities and stubs are in Go at this point. 
Java SDK has to call them by string name until Java activity interface generation is added.
